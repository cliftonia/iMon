// - Home idle/refusing → full environment (real light, day phase, weather).
// - An action ceremony → its own clean scene (no room, no weather), but the
//   lighting matches where the pet is: lit inside/by day, dark outside at night.
// - Arena (battle/training) → outdoors: lit by day, dark at night, no room/weather.
