# Release checklist

What stands between the current tree and a build in App Review, written after
the September 2026 release audit. Items are grouped by who can do them: the
code is done; the identifier decision and the App Store Connect work are the
developer's.

## Done in the audit pass (2026-09-08)

- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the watch app and the complication extension,
  declaring the UserDefaults required-reason API (CA92.1), no tracking, no
  collected data. Without it App Store Connect refuses the upload (ITMS-91053).
- The complication extension's deployment target lowered to 26.2 to match the
  app — an extension may not require a newer OS than its container.
- Display names and the complication's picker name changed to **Stepkin**;
  the complication's `kind` string is unchanged so placed complications
  survive an update.
- Apple Weather attribution and a version row under Settings → About, as the
  WeatherKit terms require wherever Apple Weather data is shown.
- Permission prompts (HealthKit, notifications) moved from the first frame of
  a fresh install to the moment the pet is alive — after the walkthrough that
  explains what steps and reminders are for. A freshly granted permission
  re-reads today's steps at once.
- Sleep is now a pause: waking re-anchors the hunger, strength and poop
  clocks, so the pet no longer wakes starved and injured after every night.
- The save keeps one backup copy; a torn or undecodable write falls back to
  the previous good save instead of hatching a new egg over a months-old pet.
- A dead pet can no longer evolve on the grave tick; leaving the pet screen
  stops the wander and sprite timers; the multi-day step catch-up is bounded
  by days rather than by successful fetches.
- Stats says "Steps off" / "Needs steps" when the Steps switch is off, and the
  Settings footer explains that evolution is step-fed.
- VoiceOver: the three buttons announce what they do; the home screen reads
  the pet's condition.
- Build warning-free, SwiftLint clean, 345 tests green.

## Decide before the upload (developer)

1. **Bundle identifiers.** The App Store Connect record (created 2026-07-19)
   is an iOS record against `cliftonia.stepkin`; the project still builds
   `cliftonia.imon`, `cliftonia.imon.watchkitapp` and
   `…watchkitapp.SkykinComplication`, and the App Group is
   `group.cliftonia.skykin`. The upload will be refused until they match.
   Changing them is a text edit in `project.pbxproj`, both entitlements files
   and `AppGroup.swift` / `ComplicationProvider.swift` — but it also **strands
   the pet on the wrist** (new container). Decide the hand-off first; see
   `migration-plan.md` § 3. The UserDefaults keys
   (`com.cliftonia.imon.petState`, `.backup`, `.complicationTimeline`) must
   *not* change in either case.
2. **Provisioning on the new App ID.** HealthKit, WeatherKit, App Groups and
   the notification capability must be ticked on `cliftonia.stepkin.watchkitapp`
   in the developer portal; WeatherKit takes time to propagate, so the first
   TestFlight build may show no weather.
3. **Export compliance.** The app uses only Apple's TLS. Set the
   "App Encryption Documentation" answer once in App Store Connect (or add
   `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` to the Info tab of both targets) so
   every build is not held for the question.

## App Store Connect (developer)

- Privacy policy URL (required for every app; HealthKit makes it mandatory).
  A one-page statement that nothing leaves the device suffices.
- Privacy nutrition labels: Health & Fitness → not collected (data never
  leaves the device); Location → not collected. Declare "Data Not Collected".
- Screenshots from the largest simulator (Ultra 3 49mm, `xcrun simctl io
  booted screenshot`) — one set covers all watch sizes.
- Age rating questionnaire: infrequent mild cartoon violence (training and
  battles), no other flags. The pet's death is fine; do not mention any
  trademarked franchise in the name, subtitle, keywords or description.
- Review notes: explain that HealthKit steps drive evolution and can be
  declined, that weather needs location and can be declined, and that the
  reviewer can reach every screen without granting anything.
- TestFlight on the physical watch for at least one full day/night cycle
  before submitting — the sleep-pause change and the permission timing are
  the two behaviours that cannot be judged in the simulator.

## Known and accepted for 1.0

- Evolution is step-fed; with HealthKit declined or the Steps switch off the
  pet cannot evolve. Stats now says so. A time-based fallback is a design
  decision for later.
- Rexkin evolves only after 15 wins at an 80 % rate, faithful to the original;
  the ring fills before the gate is met and nothing in the UI names the gate.
- The care-reminder replan and complication reload run on every wrist-down
  (`.inactive`); WidgetKit's reload budget may throttle some of them.
- The DEBUG build shows a sample weather reading; Release shows nothing until
  WeatherKit is provisioned and location granted.
