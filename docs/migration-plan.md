# Epic 2 — the founding

The one-time move from this repository to **Stepkin**: renamed, restructured
into packages, and re-homed in a fresh history. Written before the work so the
order is decided calmly rather than mid-flight.

Measured surface as of 2026-07-19: 60 `@testable import imon_Watch_App` lines,
an 897-line `project.pbxproj`, only 5 references to `imon` in app source (the
name lives almost entirely in project metadata), and a `Tools/` directory whose
scripts are already named `skykin_*`.

## Order of operations

Each step ends green — the build compiles and the suite passes — before the
next begins. Nothing is deleted until its replacement is proven.

### 1. Identity rename (Xcode, by hand — mine to specify, thine to perform)

Xcode owns project and target renames; they are not scriptable. In the current
project rename:

- the project `imon` → `Stepkin`
- target `imon Watch App` → `Stepkin Watch App` (module becomes
  `Stepkin_Watch_App`)
- target `imon` (the `watchapp2-container` stub) → `Stepkin`
- target `SkykinComplicationExtension` → `StepkinComplicationExtension`
- targets `imon Watch AppTests` / `imon Watch AppUITests` → `Stepkin …`
- the scheme names to match

Xcode will offer to rename folders and the scheme; accept. It will *not* fix
everything — that is step 2.

### 2. Repair the fallout (mine)

- every `@testable import imon_Watch_App` → `Stepkin_Watch_App` (60 lines)
- folder paths and group references left stale in `project.pbxproj`
- the entitlements filenames (`imon Watch App.entitlements`,
  `SkykinComplicationExtension.entitlements`)
- the five bundle ids → the identifiers registered in Epic 0:
  `cliftonia.stepkin`, `cliftonia.stepkin.watchkitapp`,
  `cliftonia.stepkin.watchkitapp.StepkinComplication`, and the two test bundles
- the App Group `group.cliftonia.skykin` → `group.cliftonia.stepkin`, in both
  entitlements files and `AppGroup.swift`
- display names (`INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName`) → `Stepkin`
- `Tools/skykin_*.py` → `stepkin_*.py`, and their README
- the last references in `README.md`

**Gate**: build green, 332+ tests green, and a run on the watch showing the
pet intact under the new name before proceeding.

### 3. The pet hand-off (decision pending)

New bundle ids mean a new App Group container: the pet currently on the wrist
will not be found by the renamed app. If the hand-off is wanted, it ships
here — the new app reads the old group
(`group.cliftonia.skykin`) once at first launch, adopts any save it finds,
writes it to the new group, and never looks again. It requires the *old* App
Group to remain listed in the new app's entitlements, so decide before the
provisioning profile is cut.

If declined, the wearer's creature dies with the old bundle id and Stepkin
hatches a fresh egg. Say so plainly rather than discovering it on launch day.

### 4. Package extraction

Move code in dependency order, compiling after each package:

1. `StepkinCore` — `Tagged`, `TickMath`, `TimeConstants`, logging, extensions
2. `StepkinEngine` — models, simulation, actions, evolution, battle,
   persistence DTO. **This package does not set MainActor default isolation**,
   so every explicit `nonisolated` marking on engine types can come off — the
   package boundary now enforces what the keyword was asserting by hand.
3. `StepkinSprites` — frames, animator, catalog, the per-species art
4. `StepkinUI` — presenters, view models, LCD canvas, screens, components

Engine and Core tests move with their packages and run via `swift test` — no
simulator, no scheme, seconds rather than half a minute. Only the presenter,
store, and UI tests stay in the app target.

### 5. Thin the app shells

`Apps/WatchApp` keeps only the entry point, dependency wiring, and the
platform shims (haptics, `WKApplicationRefreshBackgroundTask`, HealthKit and
WeatherKit providers). `Apps/WatchWidgets` keeps the complication.

### 6. Fresh history

`git init` in the new location, one commit, no `imon` anywhere in it — verify
with `git log -p | grep -i imon` returning nothing. The user creates the
GitHub remote and pushes. `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, this
plan, `Tools/`, and the README travel along.

## Known risks

- **Provisioning**: new App IDs mean new profiles. HealthKit, WeatherKit, App
  Groups and notifications must all be re-granted on the device — expect the
  first device run to prompt afresh.
- **WeatherKit propagation** is not instant after enabling the capability;
  a release build may show no weather for a while. In DEBUG a sample snapshot
  stands in, which can mask it.
- **The complication's bundle id** must remain nested under the watch app's,
  or the extension will not load.
- **Do not rename the `PetStateDTO` fields** during any of this. The DTO is
  the one thing the hand-off depends on being byte-compatible.
